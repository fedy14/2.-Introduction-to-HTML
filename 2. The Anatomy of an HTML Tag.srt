1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:00,870
All right.

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:08,010
So let's talk about the anatomy of NHT M-L tag and break it down to its component parts so that we can

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,170
actually understand how they're structured and how we can use them.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,330
So we've written 20:00 elements like so.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:23,410
So here we have the words hello world and they're enclosed by an opening tag and a closing tag.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,680
And in between those tags is the content that we want to apply that structure to.

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,790
So if you think back to the days of marking down a manuscript it's exactly the same as putting down

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:43,220
a quickly line underneath certain words or phrases and asking the publisher to make it bolded to affect

9
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,870
the structure of certain parts of the text.

10
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:53,010
Now in this case the publisher just happens to be our browser so these tags make requests to the browser

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,570
asking it to structure and display our plain text in the way that the web designer wanted it to be shown.

12
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,410
Now the other type of tag that we just saw are tags that don't have a closing tag.

13
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,980
They're expressed simply like so.

14
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,140
And these are called self-closing tags.

15
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,560
And we've seen that with the brake tag.

16
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,080
And there's a few more others that work like this also.

17
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,910
Now how do we find out if something requires a closing tag.

18
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,800
Or is self-closing.

19
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,570
Well this is where we head to the documentation again.

20
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:33,960
So if we have a look at the documentation for the heading elements you can see that there's this part

21
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:42,870
in the table that says Tag a mission and it says that both the starting and ending tags are mandatory

22
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:50,120
so that you can specify which portion of your text you want to apply this structure to.

23
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,920
Now we have a look at the B or the line break element.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,720
You can see that under Tiga mission.

25
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,180
It says that it must have a start tag and must not have an end tag.

26
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,740
So this is how we find out how we write our tanks.

27
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:13,890
Now while we here I want to introduce you to another element called the horizontal rule or the H R tag.

28
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:20,340
And this will allow us to create these horizontal lines above and below our portion of text.

29
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,640
So as you can see in the documentation under tagon mission it also says that it must not have an end

30
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,280
tag.

31
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,210
So this is also a self-closing tag.

32
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:37,540
So let's head back over to our pen so that we can add these two horizontal rules above and below all

33
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,300
text.

34
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,190
So the first one is going to go here

35
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,740
and the last one is going to go here so you can see that our Web page now has two horizontal lines above

36
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,430
and below our main portion of text.

37
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,890
Now if we have a closer look at this Web site you can see that there are horizontal rule is a little

38
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,380
bit thicker than ours.

39
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:05,480
So how can we make ours look more like theirs.

40
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:10,560
Now this is part where I show you a neat trick on any web page that you open in Chrome.

41
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:18,240
You can simply right click on the element that you're interested in and click inspect in order to look

42
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:25,200
at the HMO and CSSA code that's being rendered in the background by the browser so you can see here

43
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,160
they've got an H.R. element.

44
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,460
Horizontal rule.

45
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,750
But they've got Also all of this going on afterwards.

46
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,610
So what exactly is that.

47
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:43,680
Now we know that the first part of the tag is the HTL element and it's B.

48
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,560
Shaw whatever it is that you want to use.

49
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,230
Now the second part inside the angle bracket or inside or tag is new.

50
00:03:52,410 --> 00:04:01,290
And this is called an HMO attribute and it basically gives more information to the browser to specify

51
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,810
modifications to that HDMI element.

52
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:11,560
So in this case we're saying that we want a horizontal rule but we wanted in size 3.

53
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:18,060
Now what is size 3 mean and how do we know that we have these attributes available to us.

54
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,390
You've guessed that we're going back to the documentation.

55
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,690
Now I know we're making a big deal about going to the documentation but it really really is an important

56
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:34,440
skill understanding and being able to look up the documentation being familiar with the structure of

57
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,220
it and where to look.

58
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,170
In order to find out how to implement or do certain things.

59
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,920
So if we have a look at our documentation for each other you can see that there's this section called

60
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,590
attributes and that's what we spoke about just now.

61
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:59,580
The attribute comes after the attribute comes after the main HDMI element from and is separated from

62
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,830
the element by a single space.

63
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:08,700
In this case the horizontal rule element has actually quite a few attributes including a line so you

64
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:15,330
can specify whether if you want your hars onto line to align to the left or line to the right or be

65
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,820
centered you can specify the color of the horizontal rule.

66
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:26,580
You can set weather if you want the horizontal rules have shading or not and you can also set the height

67
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:32,910
in pixels of that horizontal rule which is what we saw earlier on over here.

68
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:40,140
So in this case the reason why they're horizontal rule looks different to ours is because ours is by

69
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:49,110
default only one pixel high or one pixel in size whereas there's if you inspect in the HD M-L is 3 pixels

70
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:56,310
in height and they've also specified no shade i.e. no shading to the horizontal rule.

71
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:03,570
So if we want to make our website a seamless copy of what we see here then we also have to specify those

72
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,770
attributes.

73
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,700
So if you remember the horizontal rule is a self-closing tag.

74
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,970
And so inside the tie we're going to make a space and then we're going to specify the name of the attribute

75
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,680
which we know from the documentation to be called the size attribute.

76
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,380
And we're going to set it to equal three pixels and then we're going to specify that it is no shade

77
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,890
i.e. no shading.

78
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,250
And we know all of this from the documentation.

79
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:36,450
So now once our code updates you can see that this brand new hars onto a rule looks completely different

80
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,120
from what it was before.

81
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:45,180
And we can copy this over to the top as well so that all horizontal rules look exactly the same as what

82
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,710
we've got over here.

83
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:53,250
So now we've seen HDMI elements that require an opening tag as well as a closing tag.

84
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,490
We've also seen T.M. elements that have a self-closing tag.

85
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:04,470
And finally we've seen that HDMI elements can also have an attribute where you can specify modifications

86
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,570
to the default element.

87
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:14,610
Now all we need is just to add one final tag code center to or a simple file and we would have now faithfully

88
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,490
copied what this Web site looks like.

89
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:24,410
So you can have a look through the eight CML by remember right clicking and inspecting in Chrome.

90
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:29,400
And you can look through to see how they've structured the rest of the document as well.

91
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,290
Now this is a good point to mention.

92
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:38,350
Our first challenge so we've got this code pen now where we've been messing around with the HMO.

93
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,750
Now you can either save this anonymously or you can create a free encode pen in order to be able to

94
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,600
access this later on.

95
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:53,130
But I want you to create a brand new pen and this pen is going to be our code playbook and you're going

96
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:57,200
to use this document as an interactive notebook if you will.

97
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:04,480
And I want you to document here all the new things that you've learnt as we progress through the course.

98
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:09,750
So for example in this and the last lesson we learn about the H1 tag.

99
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:16,660
So in our code playbook the first thing that's going to go in is your H-1 tag and you can say that this

100
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:27,550
is a level one heading created using the H1 tag we can go ahead and close it off and you can look through

101
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:34,320
the documentation to perhaps copy some of these code snippets over but make sure that whenever you're

102
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:41,410
copying pasting code that you understand what it is that you've copied over you understand what the

103
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:42,760
code does.

104
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,130
There's nothing worse than copying and pasting code that breaks your Web site because you don't understand

105
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,920
what you've put in there so we can go ahead and then modify each of these so that when we're creating

106
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,770
our own Web sites and we want to come back to our playbook and have it as a point of reference then

107
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:05,830
we'll be able to see easily at a glance all of the elements that we've used and that we've learnt about

108
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,380
before.

109
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:14,530
So my challenge to you is to create your very own code playbook and to start keeping notes on all the

110
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,760
things that you're learning in this course.

111
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:23,630
Now sometimes with certain elements for example the line break you don't have to put any text inside

112
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:28,240
a line break in the same way that we've done so for the H-1 tag.

113
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,850
So this is a point where you can use a comment instead.

114
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:40,860
In your aged him l file so comments are portions of tags which are marked out to be ignored by the browser.

115
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,900
And they usually places where you write notes to yourself or notes to fellow programmers who might be

116
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,750
looking at your code.

117
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:58,030
So NHT M-L we create a comment by using the angle Bacchante a exclamation mark two dashes and then to

118
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,240
close off the comment.

119
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:07,140
We use another two dashes and a closing angle bracket and everything in between here is a common.

120
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:13,630
You can see that usually it gets highlighted in a different color and none of it gets interpreted into

121
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,770
the web page.

122
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,500
So this is where you can put sections for your notes.

123
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,930
For example self-closing tags.

124
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:27,040
You can make it into several paragraphs just by putting the closing tag at the bottom and you can write

125
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,690
notes on the elements as we come across them and keep this for your own reference.

126
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:38,620
By the time when you're ready to create your own web site it will be a goldmine of a resource to jog

127
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,360
your memory on all of the lessons that you've learned.

128
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:47,710
So in the next lesson we're going to be building our very first web site and it's going to be really

129
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:52,510
really awesome because we're going to be using a real text editor and we're going to be putting that

130
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,850
Web site live onto the Internet.

131
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,850
So there's all of that and more yet to come.

132
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,950
So I will see you on the next lesson.
