1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:08,710
All right so now let's tackle what exactly is HVM mill and how do we use it to structure websites.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,260
So no matter what you use as your browser it could be chrome.

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,350
It could be Safari or Firefox.

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:24,330
They all have a single purpose and that's to interpret your files such as your HDMI files or CSSA files

5
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,240
or javascript files into a Web site that should be displayed.

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,440
So for example we've got a little bit of HVM l code here that says that our web site should have a title

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:34,700
code.

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,410
Hello.

9
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,180
And in the body there should be a heading that says Hello world.

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:48,240
So if we pass that code into our browser it will open it and display it like so with the title of the

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:55,890
Web site usually on the top and that H-1 or that big Hedding showing up in the body of our website.

12
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:02,580
So before we dive deep into this it's really important to remember that H Tim L is the foundation of

13
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,780
all Web sites.

14
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:10,890
So for example you won't see Web sites are created using just a CSSA file or just a javascript file

15
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,260
but you can create Web sites using just an HMO file.

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,510
Now it might not look great.

17
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,970
It'll probably look like it came from the 90s but it does enable your website to display tags or various

18
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:30,310
elements such as images or forms or tables depending on how you code up the T.M. file.

19
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:37,320
So each channel stands for hypertext markup language and the really important part here is the word

20
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,230
markup because there's many markup languages.

21
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:47,400
For example you might have heard of things such as XML Extensible Markup Language or DML generalized

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,850
markup language and all of these languages share a common history.

23
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:59,130
They're based off some markup that used to be put into manuscripts where editors would mark up the manuscript

24
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,190
and either specify changes to the author or specify structure and layout to the publishers.

25
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:11,580
So for example you might have the squiggly line that shows the publishers that this part should be printed

26
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:19,000
in bold or this part should be printed in a tallis and HMO works in much the same way.

27
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:26,120
You can specify the layout and structure of your website by using HVM l tags.

28
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:32,610
So if you head over to your browser and go to a Web site called Code Pennicott IO then we can have a

29
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:38,370
look and have a play around with real life live DML so you don't have to sign up.

30
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:45,600
Just head over to code Penda IO and then hit create new pen and then we're going to change the view

31
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,560
to a format like this.

32
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,000
So this is the live version of our website and these are the places where we're going to put our code.

33
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:58,950
So as you can see code penned that you put in HCM LCS us and javascript which will together get interpreted

34
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,680
and get shown on the left as your Web site.

35
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,760
Now as we're only working with HDMI at the moment I'm going to minimize the CSSA and Javascript sections

36
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,500
and I'm just going to work from the HD M-L section.

37
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,430
Now we're going to need some text to work with or have something which we can give structure to.

38
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:27,870
If you head over to Gutenburg to auxlang ebook slash 1 6 6 1 you get taken to the adventures of Sherlock

39
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,870
Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle.

40
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,760
So one of my favorite books of all time.

41
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,990
If you have a look down here you can see that you can view the book as plain text.

42
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:42,750
All you can read this book on line as HMO.

43
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,870
So this is what the plain text looks like.

44
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,390
It has all of the text in the book but absolutely no structure.

45
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:58,200
But when we have a look at the H.T. a mouse file you can see that it has laid out the book with a structure

46
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,570
that is more human readable.

47
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,030
And this is what we're going to replicate using HCM.

48
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:10,620
So if you go ahead and just copy this part The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle

49
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,670
and you copy and and place it into your pen.

50
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:22,530
So in the H.M.S. here now you can see that all of these tags gets put onto the screen with absolutely

51
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,410
no structure.

52
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:29,900
And in order for this to start looking like this we're going to start adding a little bit of HMO.

53
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:37,590
So the first thing we can see is that this is the largest heading on the page so we can make our website

54
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,460
look like that.

55
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:47,010
Also by adding an H1 tag into our HMO so the tags start with angular brackets and end with angular brackets

56
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,640
and in the middle is the type of element or the type of type you want to use.

57
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,950
Now it's really important that when you open ties that also closed them because as you can see here

58
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,510
I've got an open TYG.

59
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:08,500
But I have yet to close it and it thinks that the entire contents of my page should be made into the

60
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,440
largest heading possible and that's not what I want.

61
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,840
I only wanted for this section the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.

62
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,450
So in order to close the tie it's the same angle brackets.

63
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:23,070
But then I have to use a forward slash and then write H-1.

64
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:30,180
So now only this part is an H1 or a large heading.

65
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:36,280
Now if we have a look at the other parts I would say that this word buy is a little bit smaller than

66
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,380
the author's name.

67
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,540
So let's structure this as a heading or so.

68
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:46,900
But let's make it a subtitle so let's make it a slightly smaller heading and to do that we can simply

69
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:55,240
wrap this text around an H to tag it and now we have Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as a heading but in a smaller

70
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,870
size and shown with less importance than the big title.

71
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,350
So now finally we have this word by.

72
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:10,900
And I reckon that's one size smaller than this heading so let's go ahead and wrap this inside an H 3.

73
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,840
So I hope you're starting to get the gist.

74
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,760
The heading tags get smaller as the number goes up.

75
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:27,640
So for example if I changed this to an age 4 it gets even smaller h 5 smaller still and all the way

76
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:34,000
until age 6 which is the smallest font size for the heading element.

77
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,400
Now if you keep going to H 7 you'll notice that it doesn't do anything anymore.

78
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:49,420
It doesn't change the heading size and that's because the heading elements only go from 8 1 to 8 6.

79
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,220
Now how do I know that.

80
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,480
I hear you ask.

81
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,330
So this is a good point in the course to introduce documentation.

82
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:04,270
And the reason why I'm talking about it so early on is because of how important it is to your journey

83
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,110
as a web developer.

84
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:12,280
So one of the key skills in becoming a great web developer or fact any sort of programmer is getting

85
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:19,310
good at finding out how you can help yourself and a lot of that involves getting good at googling.

86
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:24,730
How do you find the specific piece of information that's going to help you achieve what it is that you

87
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:28,120
want or help you understand what it is that you want to know.

88
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:36,340
So in this case we're talking about headings and we are using HMO and I'm going to add in the name of

89
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:42,920
the documentation that I preferred to use which is EMDIN and it stands for the Mozilla developer network.

90
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,090
So the same people who made Firefox for example.

91
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,200
So if I go ahead and hit enter.

92
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,630
You see a whole bunch of results come up.

93
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:56,130
And the most relevant for us is the H-1 to age 6 and it talks about headings.

94
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:02,110
So if we click on that you can learn more about the heading elements used in Tamil and they even have

95
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:07,330
example code snippets that show you what it would look like rendered in a browser.

96
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,530
Now there's a couple of sources for documentation.

97
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:15,470
One is of course MT-NW Another one is called W3 schools.

98
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,300
So let's see if we tried to have three schools with HDMI.

99
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,650
And we're talking about headings right.

100
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,090
See what we get here.

101
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,970
So she M-L headings is the first result that comes up.

102
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:32,680
And similarly you've got the code examples you've got the results and you've got a little bit of notes

103
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,610
that tell you how you should be using your headings.

104
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:42,990
So both of these places have a lot of really useful usage notes and it's worth reading through your

105
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,460
first coming across a particular element.

106
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:51,570
That way you'll have a good foundation of knowledge when you start to build and create your own websites.

107
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:56,430
So I want to show you one last resource that I quite like using which is called Def docs.

108
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,190
I know.

109
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:03,100
And this is basic web site that puts together a lot of the useful documentation in a structure that

110
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,320
I find to be quite handy.

111
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:13,630
So if we have a look inside the HCM L5 tab and we go into the elements we can see that there's a total

112
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:20,490
of 135 elements and if you scroll down you can see that we've got 8 1 through age 6.

113
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:25,600
And if you click on any of these then it brings up actually the MDA and documentation so you can see

114
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,600
that it's similar to what we saw on MDA but it's just structured in a very simple way and it's very

115
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
easy to follow.

116
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,240
So that's definitely a Web site that's worth bookmarking.

117
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:41,380
So if we head back over to our age e-mail file We're going to change that back to an H-3 which is an

118
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,280
age old tag that actually exists as opposed to something like h 9.

119
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:52,150
So the next thing that we need to do in order to better replicate this Web site is to add some space

120
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,160
between these lines.

121
00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:00,620
Now in a word processor such as Word or google docs you'll be able to simply just hit a few times or

122
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,240
hit return a few times and get that speccing show up.

123
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,050
Now unfortunately in HVM Well it doesn't quite work like that.

124
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:13,290
It's a little bit more complicated in order to create that spacing.

125
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:19,510
We actually have to use an 80 shemale element called a line break and it's written like so.

126
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:27,280
And the interesting thing about this HDMI element is that it doesn't require both an open and a closed

127
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,020
hug.

128
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,190
So we have the H 1 3 2 h 6 tags.

129
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:38,090
You can see that we started out by marking the text with an H1 and then we close it off with a closing

130
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:45,530
tag but the line break element works all by itself and you can even put it inside like so to make this

131
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,390
part go onto a new line.

132
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:52,690
Now this is a good time point to review the anatomy of HTL tags.
